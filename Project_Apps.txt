Projects + Apps
---------------




--------------------
Creating a project + files defining
--------------------
$ cd Desktop
$ mkdir helloworld
$ cd helloworld

$ pipenv install django==3.0
$ pipenv shell

$ django-admin startproject helloworld_project .

Project Files:
__init__.py : is to tell python this is a package
settings.py : file controls our project settings
urls.py : tells Django which pages to build in response to a
browser or url request.
manage.py : is used to execute various django commands.
--------------------





--------------------
python manage.py migrate
--------------------
migrate command creates a new SQLite database and any necessary
database tables , according to the settings file created by the 
startproject command.
--------------------




--------------------
An App + files defining
--------------------
Django uses the concept of projects and apps to keep code clean
and readable.
A single project can contain many apps,each app focus on a 
specfic task.
Apps are designed to be portable, so one app can work for more than
one project.

Create App:
$ python manage.py startapp pages

App Files:
admin.py is a configuration file for the built-in Django Admin app

apps.py is a configuration file for the app itself

migrations/ keeps track of any changes to our models.py file 
so our database and models.py stay in sync

models.py is where we define our database models which 
Django automatically translates into database tables

tests.py is for our app-specific tests

views.py is where we handle the request/response logic for our web app


Once we create an app, we add the app inside settings.py of project-level:
# helloworld_project/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'pages.apps.PagesConfig', # new
]
